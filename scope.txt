the idea for this project is to create a team post app service. many clients will run from same server. each client will have their own 'domain'.

structure:
app administrator:
||
client domain/admin
||   ||  
client employees/team members


app admin will be able to manage and see all clients accounts

client domain is strictly available to each own client

client admin cann add/remove employees/team members from their domain
